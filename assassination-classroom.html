            <img src="ac.jpg" alt="Assassination Classroom" class="img" width="270px" height="auto"> Earth is threatened by an enormously powerful octopus-like monster who destroyed 70% of the Moon, permanently
            rending it into the shape of a crescent. The monster claims that within a year, Earth will also be destroyed
            by him, but he offers mankind a chance to avert this fate. In class 3-E; the End Class of Kunugigaoka Junior
            High School, he starts working as a homeroom teacher where he teaches his students regular subjects as well as
            the ways of assassination. The Japanese government promises a reward of ¥10 billion (i.e. 100 million USD) to
            whoever among the students succeeds in killing the monster, whom they have named "Koro-sensei" (殺せんせー Korosensē,
            a pun on korosenai (殺せない, unkillable) and sensei (先生, teacher)). However, this proves to be an almost impossible
            task, as not only does he have several superpowers at his disposal, including the capacity of moving at Mach
            20, but he is also the best teacher they've ever had, helping them to improve their grades, individual skills,
            and perspectives for the future. As the series goes on, the entire situation gets even more complicated as other
            assassins come after Koro-sensei's life, some coveting the reward, others for personal reasons. The students
            eventually learn the secrets involving him, the Moon's destruction and his ties with their previous homeroom
            teacher, including the true reason why he must be killed before the end of the year term.
