            Shinichi Kudo is a high school detective who sometimes works with the police to solve cases. During an investigation,
            he is attacked by members of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. They force him to ingest an experimental
            poison, but instead of killing him, the poison transforms him into a child. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa
            and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her
            father Kogoro Mouri, who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Kogoro's
            cases, but when he is able to solve one, he uses a tranquilizer needle to put Kogoro to sleep, and impersonates
            his voice using a voice changer to reveal the solution to the case. He also enrolls in a local elementary
            school where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective club (Detective
            Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with a variety of
            characters, including his professor friend Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Sonoko, a fellow teenage detective
            Heiji Hattori, various police detectives from different regions, and the Kaito Kid. Kudo later
            encounters an elementary school transfer student, Ai Haibara, who reveals herself to be the creator
            of the poison that made him small. She too had ingested the poison, but she is no longer affiliated with the
            Black Organization. She soon joins the Junior Detectives. During a rare encounter with the Black Organization,
            Conan helps the FBI plant a CIA agent, Kir, inside the Black Organization as a spy.
