            <img src="dn.jpg" alt="Death Note" class="img" width="270px" height="auto"> Light Yagami is a genius high school student who discovers the "Death Note", a notebook that kills anyone whose
            name is written in it, as long as the writer is thinking of that person's face as they write. After experimenting
            with the notebook, Light meets the Shinigami Ryuk, the notebook's original owner, who dropped the notebook to
            the human world out of boredom. Light tells Ryuk of his plan to rule as a god over a new world free from criminals,
            where only people he deems morally fit to live remain. Light becomes known to the public as Kira (キラ), which
            is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word "killer". He continues to bring 'Justice' upon the world
            as a self proclained god. Ryuk, invisible except to those that possess the Death Note, follows Light around and
            takes enjoyment from Light's meticulous actions as Kira. Kira's killings catch the attention of Interpol and
            world-famous detective "L". L, who is highly intelligent, has surmised that Kira can kill anyone by knowing their
            face and name, and tricks Light into revealing his location in the Kanto region of Japan. L creates a small anti-Kira
            task force from the local police to help discover who Kira is, including Soichiro, Light's father, requiring
            Light to take several measures to keep the Death Note secure. Light and L begin a game of cat and mouse to try
            to further their own ends. Once Light is in college, he joins L and his anti-Kira task force in hopes of finding
            a way to learn L's name and kill him. Light's plan is impeded by a love-struck second Kira, famous model Misa
            Amane, and her Shinigami Rem. Misa finds out that Light is the first Kira and offers her assistance to him. However,
            Misa's infatuation with Light causes her to make several strategic errors, allowing L to gain enough evidence
            to detain her as the second Kira. L suspects Light is the first Kira, leading Light and Misa to create a plan
            to throw L off track. Light allows himself to be detained, and both relinquish ownership of their Death Notes,
            erasing all memories they had of using it. While detained, a third Kira appears, proving Light and Misa's innocence,
            and L releases them into house arrest in his headquarters. The anti-Kira task force identify the third Kira as
            Yotsuba Group executive Kyosuke Higuchi, who has been using Misa's Death Note. Higuchi is captured, and Light
            touches the Death Note, regaining all his memories. He kills Higuchi to retake possession of the notebook. After
            apprehending Higuchi, the anti-Kira task force learns of the Death Notes and their function, and the existence
            of Shinigamis associated with them. Light then manipulates Rem into killing L after putting Misa in a life-threatening
            situation. Because purposely killing to prolong the lifespan of a human violates Shinigami law, Rem also dies.
            Upon L's death, Light becomes the second "L" and continues his charade of searching for Kira while carrying out
            the killings himself with help from Misa. The narrative picks up four years later, with Kira attracting a large
            network of contacts and a swell of public support. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed
            – Near, a detective associated with the United States Government, and Mello, a member of the Mafia. Mello uses
            criminal means to get closer to Kira. One of Mello's plans results in the death of Soichiro. Meanwhile, Near's
            investigation of Kira leads him to suspect that Light is acting as both the current L and Kira. After Soichiro's
            death, Near plants seeds of suspicion in the task force. In response, Light persuades Misa to give up her notebook
            and raises another "Kira", Teru Mikami, a prosecutor and fervent supporter of Kira. Mikami recruits Kiyomi Takada,
            a newscaster, to serve as Kira's public spokeswoman. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps
            Takada. She kills Mello, and is in turn killed by Light. However, Mikami's actions as a result of the kidnapping
            enable Near to set up a trap that implicates both Light and Mikami as Kira. The task force and Near's investigation
            team capture the two of them and force a confession out of Light. Ryuk, realizing Light is no longer able to
            entertain him, kills Light with his notebook, as he promised to do so in the beginning of the story.
